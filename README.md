# Copy to Objects 

Recognizing and solving a daily problem faced by 3D modelers around me by coding a workflow optimizing tool for Maya 2022. This tool was built using Python, PyQt and MayaCMDS.

PROBLEM: Modelers from time to time need to try out new models into their bigger models. For example - changing tires of a car, changing windows of a building or it could be changing leaves of a tree. These tasks involve a tremendous amount of grunt work, to replace each object one at a time.

SOLUTION: The tool focuses on changing multiple objects with a selected object within a second with a click. The tool duplicates the selected object and clones the transform data to replace the undesired objects.
